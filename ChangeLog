[Changes for 0.02 - August 14, 2002]

This release fixed the showstopping bug on recent Tk environments, where
<Keypress-?> should be written <Keypress-question>.  Thanks for various
people who wrote in to notify me of this bug.

Essentially, nothing had been changed after one year. :-/  If anybody
wishes to volunteer maintainership for this module, I'd be really happy.

[Changes for 0.01 - August 28, 2001]
